Problem description:

```
Given This project is made to help find correlations between large unconnected data attributes given (i.e Weather, people movement, people visit to metro stations ...etc).
```

Goal:
```
Our goal is to improve the user-friendliness of data in an objective manner.
```
Approach:
```
We are using a machine learning module implemented in python that we have built to receive the data and analyze it to get us the correlation between attributes and each other. And regarding the data visualization we will be using Tableau.
